    "# [COM4513-6513] Assignment 2: Text Classification with a Feedforward Network\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructor: Nikos Aletras\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to develop a Feedforward network for text classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For that purpose, you will implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text processing methods for transforming raw text data into input vectors for your network  (**1 mark**)\n",
    "- A Feedforward network consisting of:\n",
    "    - **One-hot** input layer mapping words into an **Embedding weight matrix** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **One hidden layer** computing the mean embedding vector of all words in input followed by a **ReLU activation function** (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - **Output layer** with a **softmax** activation. (**1 mark**)\n",
    "- The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm with **back-propagation** to learn the weights of your Neural network. Your algorithm should:\n",
    "    - Use (and minimise) the **Categorical Cross-entropy loss** function (**1 mark**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Forward pass** to compute intermediate outputs (**4 marks**)\n",
    "    - Perform a **Backward pass** to compute gradients and update all sets of weights (**4 marks**)\n",
    "    - Implement and use **Dropout** after each hidden layer for regularisation (**2 marks**)\n",
    "- Discuss how did you choose hyperparameters? You can tune the learning rate (hint: choose small values), embedding size {e.g. 50, 300, 500}, the dropout rate {e.g. 0.2, 0.5} and the learning rate. Please use tables or graphs to show training and validation performance for each hyperparam combination  (**2 marks**). \n",
    "- After training the model, plot the learning process (i.e. training and validation loss in each epoch) using a line plot and report accuracy.\n",
    "- Re-train your network by using pre-trained embeddings ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)) trained on large corpora. Instead of randomly initialising the embedding weights matrix, you should initialise it with the pre-trained weights. During training, you should not update them (i.e. weight freezing) and backprop should stop before computing gradients for updating embedding weights. Report results by performing hyperparameter tuning and plotting the learning process. Do you get better performance? (**3 marks**).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BONUS:** Extend you Feedforward network by adding more hidden layers (e.g. one more). How does it affect the performance? Note: You need to repeat hyperparameter tuning, but the number of combinations grows exponentially. Therefore, you need to choose a subset of all possible combinations (**+2 extra marks**)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for Task 2 is a subset of the [AG News Corpus](http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html) and you can find it in the `./data_topic` folder in CSV format:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `data_topic/train.csv`: contains 2,400 news articles, 800 for each class to be used for training.\n",
    "- `data_topic/dev.csv`: contains 150 news articles, 50 for each class to be used for hyperparameter selection and monitoring the training process.\n",
    "- `data_topic/test.csv`: contains 900 news articles, 300 for each class to be used for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download pre-trained GloVe embeddings trained on Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download) from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip). No need to unzip, the file is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "To save RAM, when you finish each experiment you can delete the weights of your network using `del W` followed by Python's garbage collector `gc.collect()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit a Jupyter Notebook file (assignment2.ipynb) and an exported PDF version (you can do it from Jupyter: `File->Download as->PDF via Latex`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are advised to follow the code structure given in this notebook by completing all given funtions. You can also write any auxilliary/helper functions (and arguments for the functions) that you might need but note that you can provide a full solution without any such functions. Similarly, you can just use only the packages imported below but you are free to use any functionality from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html), NumPy, SciPy and Pandas. You are not allowed to use any third-party library such as Scikit-learn (apart from metric functions already provided), NLTK, Spacy, Keras etc.. You are allowed to re-use your code from Assignment 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to comment your code. You should also mention if you've used Windows to write and test your code. There is no single correct answer on what your accuracy should be, but correct implementations usually achieve F1 of ~75-80% and ~85% without and with using pre-trained embeddings respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be marked out of 20. It is worth 20\\% of your final grade in the module. If you implement the bonus question you can get up to 2 extra points but your final grade will be capped at 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deadline for this assignment is **23:59 on Mon, 18 May 2020** and it needs to be submitted via Blackboard (MOLE). Standard departmental penalties for lateness will be applied. We use a range of strategies to detect [unfair means](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/unfair-means/index), including Turnitin which helps detect plagiarism, so make sure you do not plagiarise.\n",
